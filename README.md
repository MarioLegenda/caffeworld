#### Introduction

About a month ago, I decided to learn WebRTC and I struggled with it a lot. During my research,
I noticed that other people struggle with it too so I decided to put into words what
I learned and what challenges did I face.

My approach in learning anything is to built an application for it. So I built a WebRTC application that
you can find [here](https://caffeworld.goiwouldlike.com). This is by no means an ultimate
tutorial for WebRTC but I will try to write every problem that I had to solve to make it work
including setting up Socket.io and Apache server in order to work with Web Sockets. 

Starting out, I also did a lot of mistakes from the beginning so I will outline some tips on how you should start and
think when building a WebRTC app. Kind of like "things that nobody told me when working with WebRTC". So in the course
of this post, I will try to give you some tips so you don't make the same mistakes that I did.
